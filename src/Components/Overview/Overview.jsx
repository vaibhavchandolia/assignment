        <p>Prestige Dew Drops is an ultra-luxury residential complex offering high-end villas. 
            The luxurious experience sprawls over 5.5 acres of serene oasis with an array of 
            high-class amenities. This regal complex has only a limited number of inventories in 
            secluded green setting to assure quality experience for the residents. 
            The private paradise offers life with a splash of opulence that feels like you are miles 
            away from the city. However, Dew Drops is strategically located near the thriving hub in 
            the northern peripheries at Yehalanka, 
            which has the unbeatable advantage of a strong social infrastructure. </p>
